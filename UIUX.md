# UI/UX

- grids are used when relevant to align content.
- only 2 fonts are used throughout the webpage for consistency, specifically:
-- all buttons and links use their own font to indicate to the user that they are clickable
-- all other text has its own font
- across our webpage we used a constrained colour palette to not clutter the user's view
-- when we required differing shades of one hue we ensured they were harmonious to not distract the viewer
- our ui uses clear visual hierarchy to define what elements are important
-- size is used primarily in text size (larger sizes for important information such as headings)
-- colour is used to show users what they can click (more saturated colours are used for buttons that let the user interact with elements on the current webpage and less saturated colours are used to navigate between pages)
-- similarly contrast is used to show the user what elements are important and what are not
-- all elements are aligned so the user is not distracted by misalignments
-- repetition is used throughout elements so the user can clearly understand what each element is
--- dashboard can always be accessed through site logo
--- buttons in the navbar always share the same style to signify links
--- all buttons are one of 3 different styles (used mutliple to be able to show importance or provide contrast)
-- all buttons when hovered over make the cursor turn into the click icon
-- all buttons not in navbar change visual state when hovered over
-- all buttons that are icons have a tooltip to describe to the user what their function is
