We changed the thumbnail of a presentation to instead be a background colour as we thought it created a better separation between each presentation on the dashboard.

On the presentation page we added borders around elements on the slide that the user clicks to communiacate to the user that they are active.

On the version history page we added the ability to preview the different presentation versions so that the user can see what changes they are reverting to.

The user can choose between 4 font-families.
