To make our code meet accessibility requirements we followed:

# 1. Percieveability

- all non-text content have alt-text explanation.
- all non-text content that are buttons have tooltips that tell the user their function when they hover over it with their mouse or by using the tab key.
- all components are distinguishable, text colour is adjusted so that it and its background always maintain high contrast
- the webpage can be zoomed up to 200% and remains at full functionality and visual flow.

# 2. Operability

- all buttons and inputs can be reached using the tab key and triggered using enter, as well as by mouse.
- arrow keys are supported where required to natvigate between slides and increase/decrease values, as well as by mouse.
- when a modal is open the tab key does not tab to buttons outside the modal.
- semantic tags are used where appropriate
- aria labels are used where HTML does not suffice.

# 3. Understandability

- all links are clear and descriptive on where they will take the user.
- all routes are unique so that the user knows what page they are on within the website.
- the webpage is easy to navigate as the user can always click/tab + enter the logo to return to the dashboard page.
- all inputs are clearly labelled such that the user understands what content to enter.
- all error messages are clear and succint such that the user understands what they must do to correct the error.
- any actions that lead to permanent removals of data give the user a clear and descriptive warning that their data will be deleted and the action cannot be undone.
- the user has the option to cancel any action that will lead to a change or loss of data.

# 4. Robustness
- HTML has no errors and is pareseable - all open tags have a matching close
- doctype is defined
- we have not used any duplicate ids
- elements with roles use semantic tags to show their roles
- code is modular and divided into descriptive files (each file has 1 role).
- all variable and functions are names decriptively.
